# statuspage - A lightweight and simple statuspage implementation

## Concept

All items defined in the `config.yml` must be refreshed periodically. If this doesn't happen the statuspage assumes the service is down.

## Generate token

Generate the token via `/dev/urandom`:

```bash
head -c 1000 /dev/urandom | sha512sum | cut -c 1-64
```

Open the `config.yml` and paste the generated token at `statuspage.token`:

```yaml
statuspage:
  ...
  token: <token>
  ...
```

## `config.yml`

The file `config.yml` holds all groups and items of the status page. A group has a name and holds several items. An item has a name and an ID. It may be up or down and can be refreshed. IDs and names can be chosen freely.

Example YAML file:

```yaml
statuspage:
  title: NIPE-SYSTEMS â€“ Status
  token: 395194575aaad69204a1298c4f838755679888e9b502285f8b5774067863b5fd
  groups:
    SomeGroup:
      - name: HTTP/HTTPS
        id: http
      - name: DNS
        id: dns
      - name: SMTP/IMAP
        id: mail
    "Group #2":
      - name: HTTP/HTTPS
        id: http
      - name: Internal DNS
        id: dns-internal
```

The following example will refresh the item with the ID `dns` which is in group *SomeGroup* and has the name *DNS*:

```
curl -v --header "X-Token: 395194575aaad69204a1298c4f838755679888e9b502285f8b5774067863b5fd" http://localhost:8080/refresh/dns
> GET /refresh/dns HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.59.0
> Accept: */*
> X-Token: 395194575aaad69204a1298c4f838755679888e9b502285f8b5774067863b5fd

{"refreshed": 1}
```

As you can see, the server responses with the number of refreshed items. The following example will refresh the item with ID `http` (two items have ID )

```
curl -v --header "X-Token: 395194575aaad69204a1298c4f838755679888e9b502285f8b5774067863b5fd" http://localhost:8080/refresh/http
